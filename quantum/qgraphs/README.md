## Networkx+PennyLane+PyTorch QGraph Example

- **Author:** Jacob Cybulski and Team
- **Date:** August-September 2024
- **Aims:** *To illustrate NX+PL+Torch development of QGraph models*

### Folders:
- sample_graphs: collection of saved graphs
- utils: which is a collection of Python files and testing notebooks to manage QGraphs, plots and quantum circuits
- legacy: previous versions dated with their time of their removal (includes legacy utilities)
  
### Important notebooks:
- pl_qgraphs_data: creates sample digraphs
- pl_qgraphs_train: creates a qgraph model and trains it
